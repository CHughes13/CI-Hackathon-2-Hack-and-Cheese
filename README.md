# Cheesy Choices!

## Overview

Quiz Time is a web-based trivia game that tests users on a wide range of subjects from geography to science. Users can enter their name, choose whether to play with a timer, and then proceed to answer multiple choice questions. The application keeps track of users' scores, correct and incorrect responses, and their best streak of correct answers.
